Enhancing Cloud-Removed Regions in Multispectral Optical Images Using SAR Edge Features

Minghua Wang, Xin Zhao, Longfei Ren

A novel Transformer-based cloud removal network (TCRNet) utilizing SAR edge features to enhance the recovered region in MSO images.

We have attached one learned parameter as 'checkpointsnet_epoch_300.pth', and you can obtain the result by testing it on the SEN12MS-CR dataset.
